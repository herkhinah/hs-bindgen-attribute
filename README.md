# `hs-bindgen`

Handy macro to generate C-FFI bindings from Rust to Haskell.

This library intended to work best in a project configured by
[`hs-pack`](https://github.com/yvan-sraka/hs-pack).

## Acknowledgments

⚠️ This is still a working experiment, not yet production ready.

`hs-bindgen` was heavily inspired by other interoperability initiatives, as
[`wasm-bindgen`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) and
[`PyO3`](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3).

This project was part of a work assignment as an
[IOG](https://github.com/input-output-hk) contractor.
